This repository contains supporting materials for my talk "[Still parsing User Agent Strings for your models? Use this instead!](https://github.com/WhyR2020/abstracts/blob/master/text_mining/still_parsing_user_agent_strings_for_your_models_use_this_instead.md)" made at the [Why R? Conference 2020](https://2020.whyr.pl/). The file with slides used in that presentation is stored in the project's root directory (`mastitsky_why_r_conference.html`).

Two example R scripts stored in the `scripts` folder can be used to create unsupervised and supervied [fastText](https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/support.html)-based transformers for UAS. To run these scripts, one can use a sample dataset provided in the folder `data` (200K unique UAS extracted from the [whatismybrowser.com](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/) database).
